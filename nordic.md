# 1. Bioinformatic Resources in Nordic Regions
Here, we aim to compile resources that have been created in Nordic regions, and that are provided by nordic researchers/research labs.

**How to contribute?** Contribute by submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/NordicCompBio/Bioinformatics-Resources/pulls), or posting suggestions as [issues](https://github.com/NordicCompBio/Bioinformatics-Resources/issues). Thank you.

## 1.1 Open-source Practice Datasets
Nordic databases containing curated and well-annotated testing datasets.

### Genomics

### Transcriptomics

### Proteomics

### Metabolomics

### Systems Biology

### Epigenetics

### Simulation

### Other

## 1.2 Coding Tutorials
Tutorials and lectures developed by Nordic organisations and/or researchers. 

### General Coding Practices

### Genomics

### Transcriptomics

### Proteomics

### Metabolomics

### Systems Biology

### Epigenetics

### Simulation

### Other

## 1.3 Bioinformatics Concepts
These could be in a form of books, articles, web pages and other resources that describe bioinformatic concepts but does not include coding practice.
