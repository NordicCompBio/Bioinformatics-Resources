# 1. Bioinformatics Resources From Nordic ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

We aim to compile a list of bioinformatics resources and tools that are created/provided by people in Nordics, for learning and training.

## 1.1 Open-source Practice Datasets
Nordic databases containing curated and well-annotated testing datasets.

### Genomics

### Transcriptomics

### Proteomics

### Metabolomics

### Systems Biology

### Epigenetics

### Simulation

### Other

## 1.2 Coding Tutorials
Tutorials and lectures developed by Nordic organisations and/or researchers. 

### General Coding Practices

### Genomics

### Transcriptomics

### Proteomics

### Metabolomics

### Systems Biology

### Epigenetics

### Simulation

### Other

## 1.3 Bioinformatics Concepts
Nordic resources in form of books, articles, web pages and other resources that describe bioinformatic concepts but does not include coding practice. 

# 2. Bioinformatic Resources From Outside Nordic:

## 2.1 General or Mixed bioinformatic resources
