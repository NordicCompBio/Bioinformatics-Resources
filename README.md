# Bioinformatics Resources From Nordic ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

We aim to compile a list of bioinformatics resources and tools that are created/provided by people in Nordics, for learning and training.

## Open-source practice datasets

## Miscelleanous Resources from/outside Nordic:
The list was initially compiled as part of [RSG-Sweden](rsg-sweden.iscbsc.org)
