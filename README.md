# Bioinformatics Resources

We aim to compile a list of bioinformatics resources that are useful for anyone interested in starting or accelerating their knowledge in the field of computational biology. Our primary aims are to: 
1. Highlight resources that have been developed and are provided by Nordic research labs. 
2. Compile a list of resources useful for learning computational biology and bioinformatics, disregarding contribution from nordic researchers.

**Structure**
- README.md contains useful information for content contribution and structure
- [nordic.md](https://github.com/NordicCompBio/Bioinformatics-Resources/blob/main/nordic.md) contains _bioinformatics resources from Nordic regions_.
- [outside_nordic.md](https://github.com/NordicCompBio/Bioinformatics-Resources/blob/main/outside_nordic.md) contains _bioinformatics resources from other regions across the globe_.

The files nordic.md and outside_nordic.md share a common structure:

|Section|Name|Description|
|-------|-----|----------|
|1.1|Open-source Practice Datasets|Resources that can be used to aquire good quality training data for various bioinformatic applications.|
|1.2|Coding Tutorials|Resources that can be used to aquire or refine existing skills in commonly used programmatic languages.|
|1.3|Bioinformatics Concepts|Resources that can used to get more in-depth information about certain bioinformatic applications or concepts.|
|1.4|Pipelines and Software|Pipelines, tools, and softwares that are commonly used in the field of bioinformatics.|
|1.5|General resources|Resources that are generally good to know about, which is not specific to a certain field or subfield of bioinformatics.|
